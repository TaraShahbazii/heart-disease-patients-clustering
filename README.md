# 🏥 Heart Disease Patients Clustering

🚀 **Discovering hidden patterns in heart disease data with clustering algorithms!**

## 📌 About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing heart disease patient data to uncover hidden patterns and group patients based on shared characteristics using **clustering algorithms** like **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **PCA**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains medical information of heart disease patients, including:
- **Age**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol Levels**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Chest Pain Types**, and more.

These features were used to group patients and analyze potential patterns related to heart disease.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering and evaluation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **PCA** for dimensionality reduction

## 🎯 Steps in the Project
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
2. **Standardization and PCA for Dimensionality Reduction**
3. **Clustering with K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering**
4. **Evaluation using Silhouette Score**
5. **Visualization of Clustering Results**

## 📈 Key Results
- **K-Means** performed well in grouping patients into clusters.
- **DBSCAN** identified outliers effectively.
- PCA helped improve clustering accuracy by reducing data dimensions.
